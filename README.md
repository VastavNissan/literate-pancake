# Randomized Quicksort 

In this algorithm I have randomized pivot selection using pseduorandom function called rand(). This in theory will decrease to the time complexity of the algorithm.
I have used seed in order to avoid repeatition of elements when running the program multiple times.
I have used Sedgwick Quicksort's Algorithm as an attempt to optimize space complexity.
