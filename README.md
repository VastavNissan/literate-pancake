# Randomized Quicksort 
  -Based on Sedgwick Quicksortâ€™s Algorithm
                 
In this algorithm I have randomized pivot selection process using pseudorandom function called rand(). This in theory will decrease the time complexity of the algorithm.
I have used seed to avoid repetition of elements when running the program multiple times. I have used Sedgwick Quicksort's Algorithm as an attempt to optimize space complexity.
